					<p>Composition</p>

					<p>I specialize in (but of course am not limited to) JRPG-style music, which is to say, highly melodic and narrative-driven 
					music in the style of Final Fantasy, the Chrono series, Tales series and so on. What made these games special wasn’t just that 
					their music was good; their music had an identity.
					</p>

					<p>Likewise, my standard is to make music that is a selling point and integral part of the identity of the games I work on, not just 
					inoffensive but forgettable background noise. I strive to make music that will help your game become a cherished and
					significant emotional experience for its players.

					<p>FAQ</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Q: “How do I know I’ll get exactly what I’m looking for?”</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p><b>A:</b> Of course, liking what you heard in the Music section above is a great start, 
						but it’s good to have a guarantee that I’ll nail what you’re looking for. Sometimes
						the vision of what you want is a little blurry and takes some time to suss out, and that’s okay! 
						I'll figure out what you're looking for by keeping in frequent contact, even if you know nothing about music and have a difficult time
						communicating exactly what you want.
						</p>
					</div>

				<button class="accordion">Q: “What are your prices/how do you pricing?”</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>A: It's very difficult to give a flat rate because projects vary so wildly, but
						I’m very flexible with pricing as well as pricing models, and we’ll talk both out right at the start 
						so you don’t have to wake up in cold sweats at night wondering about costs. If pay-per-minute freaks 
						you out a bit, I’m happy to do — and personally quite like — the pay-per-project model. Whatever the model, however, 
						I take deeply personal pride in the quality of my music, so my concern is making music that’s everything 
						it should be over optimizing my time:money ratio.</p>
					</div>

				<button class="accordion">Q: “What genres can you do?”</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>A: Just about any, but my specialties are symphonic and prog rock, world and orchestral. 
						Think Nobuo Uematsu and Motoi Sakuraba (of Final Fantasy and Tales/Souls series fame) 
						for symphonic/prog rock and orchestral, and Yasunori Mitsuda (of Chrono/Xeno series fame) for world if
						you're unfamiliar.</p>
					</div>
					
				<button class="accordion">Q: “What if I want something that sounds more like older games and less like a live orchestra?”</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>A: In my music demo, the songs are produced with live orchestral samples, but this sound has less to do with the
						music itself and more with the soundfont. I can adjust my compositions to any soundfont you think will fit your game, be it 
						something like the old SNES soundfonts or live orchestra samples.</p>
					</div>
					
				<button class="accordion">Q: “Can I hire you for individual commissions/songs?”</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>A: You certainly can! Prices vary depending on a variety of factors, so just get up with me through the contact form at the
						bottom of the page so we can talk about what you need and the details of pricing. </p>

					<p>My name’s Geoff Butterworth, also known as Vermanubis, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. </p>
					
					<p>Game music has been my life since I was 5 years old 
					when I would play all the way through Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest just to jam to the final dungeon theme.
					As I got older, I started to realize that game music got into my heart and made me feel in ways
					no other kind of music came close to.
					</p>
					
					<p>Since about that age it's been my life's work to understand and perfect what makes game music so special
					and to get others to feel what my most beloved games made me feel in my own work. If you can see that fact 
					reflected in my work and want music that will stay with your players forever, I can't overstate
					how happy I'd be to oblige and work with you to make something that'll mean something to people.
